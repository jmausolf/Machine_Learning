# Predicting High School Dropouts
According to the U.S. Department of Education, over 1.2 million American students drop out of high school annually. These dropouts are more likely to engage in criminal activity, require social services, or become teenage parents. Subsequently, without a high school diploma, they become ineligible to pursue certain careers and the higher salary that follows. In order to address this critical issue, understanding which factors contribute to dropping out of high school is of critical importance.

Our goal with this project is to develop a scalable ranking system that will allow a school system to target their interventions to individuals who are most immediately at risk for dropping out of high school.
