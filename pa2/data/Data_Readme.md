# Data Readme

Several datasets are used for this assignment, pa2.

The base dataset was the 'cs-training.csv' file. This is the primary file used in __1_and_2_Read_and_Describe_Data.py.

In __3_Missing_Data_Processing.py, I also use 'cs-training.csv'. I output several new files during the process, chiefly 'cs-training#3B.csv', which is the primary file used in the features and classifier python scripts.

Each of these latter scripts has several options to generate and save additional CSV files, depending on the options selected.

The python files should be able to run in succession without modification if 'cs-training.csv' is put into the /data directory.
